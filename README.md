# AI-Voice-Assistant

## Project Overview

JARVIS is an advanced AI-based voice assistant built with Python. Inspired by the fictional AI from Iron Man, this assistant can perform a range of tasks, interact with users through voice, and provide helpful information from the web. The assistant is designed to simplify everyday digital tasks with ease and efficiency.

## Features

### Voice Interaction:
JARVIS greets the user based on the time of day (e.g., "Good morning," "Good afternoon") and responds through voice output.

### Open YouTube and Play Music: 
The assistant can launch YouTube and open specific links like music or videos based on user commands.

### Search Wikipedia: 
JARVIS searches Wikipedia for any topic requested by the user and provides the results as voice output.

### Open Web Links: 
The assistant can open web links for specific websites or content.

### User-Friendly Responses: 
It provides conversational and informative responses in a friendly tone.

## Technologies Used

Python: Core language for development.

Speech Recognition: To capture and understand voice commands.

Text-to-Speech (TTS): For voice-based responses.

Web Scraping: To fetch data from Wikipedia and other web sources.

Web Automation: To open web pages like YouTube and specific links.
